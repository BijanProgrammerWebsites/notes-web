# Meta

## Favicon

Use [this app](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
to generate favicon and other useful materials.

## Open Graph

Visit [bijanprogrammer.com](https://bijanprogrammer.com/) and copy it's head element and change it as needed.

[This article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-open-graph-and-how-can-i-use-it-for-my-website/#what-happens-if-i-don-t-have-it)
might be helpful as well.

[This app](https://webcode.tools/)
has a lot of great tools to generate meta-related materials.

Use [this app](https://opengraph.dev/)
to check if Open Graph tags are set properly.

:::warning

I don't know if it's necessary or not, but you should probably put
`prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#"`
on the html tag.

:::warning

Image links has to be absolute like `https://bijanprogrammer.com/banner.webp`.
Otherwise, some testing websites can't find them.

## Manifest

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)
has a reliable doc for each member of the manifest file.

For more advanced tutorial (probably for PWA), you can use
[web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest)'s article.

## Telegram

There is a [Webpage bot](https://t.me/WebpageBot/)
which presumably can force Telegram to update a website's preview.
You can use it if Telegram's preview is not updating.
